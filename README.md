# Geert's solutions to the Advent of Code 2023

This is the fourth year that I decided to participate in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I decided to try to also learn some new skills this year, learning more about modern Python and trying to automatically generate a GitHub Pages site with my solutions, which you can find [here](http://geertlitjens.nl/advent-of-code-2023/).
