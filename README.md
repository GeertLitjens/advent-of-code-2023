# Geert's solutions to the Advent of Code 2023

This is the fourth year that I have decided to participate in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I decided to try to learn some new skills this year, learning more about modern Python and trying to automatically generate a GitHub Pages site with my solutions, which you can find [here](http://geertlitjens.nl/advent-of-code-2023/).

## Usage

Anyone can use this repository as a template; it contains a command line utility that can:
- Create a new Day folder, corresponding test, and download your user-specific input so you only need to implement the solution, typically consisting of three functions: parse_data, solve_part1, and solve_part2
- Submit the results to the Advent of Code website and, using a Github hook adapt this Readme.md to show the solved stars
- Generate a Github Pages blog from your code and module comments (see an example here: https://geertlitjens.nl/advent-of-code-2022)

To use most features, you need your API token for Advent of Code, and either give it to the executable or add it as an environmental variable AOC_TOKEN or a .aoc_token file in your home folder. To get the token, see here: https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1.

Good luck!
